    <h1>To know about you have to travel with me.</h1>
    <p> 
        I am an enthusiastic Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) student with a strong passion for full-stack development in Java. With a solid foundation in MySQL and ongoing progress in Java, I am continuously honing my skills to become a proficient developer. I have successfully completed a Long Term Virtual Internship in Front-End Development and a certification in Data Analytics Process Automation, which have equipped me with practical experience in building dynamic and data-driven applications. I am also committed to self-improvement through initiatives like the 100-day coding challenge, where I document my full-stack development journey to share insights and growth with my professional network. My interests extend beyond technology to include healthy living and exploring passive income opportunities, such as content creation on YouTube. I am eager to connect, collaborate, and contribute to innovative projects in the tech space.
