     <h1>There are forests of feelings inside you.</h1>
     <h2>May you end someone who knows how to water your soul.</h2>
     <h3>Someone who not only notices your absence but also hates it.</h3>
     <hr>
     <h4>Someone who never lets you question if there’s 
          <br>something fundamentally wrong with you—if you deserve to be loved.</h4> 
     <h5>Someone who loves you as if that’s what they were made for—loving you with all their heart.</h5>
     <h6>Someone who makes you fall in love with the days you didn’t even think you’d be alive to see.</h6>
     <hr>
     <p>Someone who never lets you give up on yourself by giving you all the love you deserve.</p>
     <pre>It's not like we always have someone to share our feeling or to love us.
          actually we are the one to love ourselves.
