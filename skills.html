        <li>Java</li><sub> 
            Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) in 1995. Known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability, Java allows developers to create applications that can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable and versatile. It is widely used for developing web applications, enterprise software, mobile apps (Android), and more.  
            
            Java follows key principles such as simplicity, robustness, security, and platform independence. It supports features like automatic memory management (garbage collection), multithreading, and a rich set of libraries that make development efficient and scalable. The language is commonly used in frameworks like Spring and Hibernate for enterprise applications and remains a top choice for backend development due to its reliability and performance.  
            
            Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Java offers a strong foundation for software development across various domains.</sub>
        <li>Sql</li><sub>Structured Query Language (SQL) is a powerful language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently. SQL is widely used in industries to handle structured data and is essential for backend development, data analysis, and business intelligence.

            Key features of SQL include:
            
            Data Querying: Using commands like SELECT to retrieve data from databases.
            Data Manipulation: Performing operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
            Data Definition: Creating and modifying database structures with CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.
            Data Control: Managing access and security using GRANT and REVOKE.
            SQL is used with popular database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server, making it a crucial skill for anyone working with data.</sub>
        <li>Html</li><sub>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides the basic building blocks for web content by using elements and tags to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. HTML forms the foundation of web development, working alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

            Key features of HTML include:
            
            Semantic Structure: Elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer> improve content organization.
            Multimedia Support: Embedding images, videos, and audio with <img>, <video>, and <audio> tags.
            Forms and Inputs: Collecting user data using <form>, <input>, and <button>.
            Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensuring pages work across different web browsers.
            HTML is an essential skill for web developers and is the first step toward creating engaging and accessible websites.</sub>
